# 3D Models for 3D Printing

Explore the 3D models designed for the Li-ion Battery Sorter project, ready for 3D printing using Fusion 360. These models are not just for visual representation; they are functional components that can be 3D printed and integrated into the Li-ion Battery Sorter.

## Fusion 360 Project

The 3D models are hosted on Fusion 360, and you can access the project by following this link: [3D Models](https://a360.co/3MntBkZ).

In the Fusion 360 project, you can view, interact with, and download the 3D models for 3D printing to assemble the Li-ion Battery Sorter.

## Components for 3D Printing

Here's a list of key components included in the 3D models, ready for 3D printing:

- **[List the key 3D-printable components]**: Provide a brief description of each component, its role in the device, and any specific 3D printing requirements.

Feel free to use these 3D models for 3D printing and integrate them into your hardware assembly for the Li-ion Battery Sorter.

## Preview

[Include images or screenshots of the 3D models, emphasizing their suitability for 3D printing.]
