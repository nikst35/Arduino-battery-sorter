# 3D Models for 3D Printing

Explore the 3D models designed for the Li-ion Battery Sorter project, ready for 3D printing using Fusion 360. These models are not just for visual representation; they are functional components that can be 3D printed and integrated into the Li-ion Battery Sorter.

## Fusion 360 Project

The 3D models are hosted on Fusion 360, and you can access the project by following this link: [3D Models](https://a360.co/3MntBkZ).

In the Fusion 360 project, you can view, interact with, and download the 3D models for 3D printing to assemble the Li-ion Battery Sorter.
