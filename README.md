# Li-ion Battery Sorter

Welcome to the Li-ion Battery Sorter project repository. This project is a battery sorting device designed to efficiently categorize Li-ion cells based on their Internal Resistance (IR) using the Kelvin Double Bridge method.

## Overview

The Li-ion Battery Sorter is a hardware and software solution that enables the sorting of Li-ion cells into different categories based on their internal resistance. The device employs advanced measurement techniques and algorithms to accurately determine the internal resistance of each battery, providing valuable data for various applications, including battery pack assembly and quality control.

## Key Features

- **High Precision Sorting**: Accurate measurement of Internal Resistance (ISR) for precise battery sorting.
- **ATmega328P-Based Device**: The core of the device is an ATmega328P microcontroller, known for its reliability and performance.
- **Kelvin Double Bridge Method**: Utilizes the Kelvin Double Bridge technique for precise ISR measurement.
- **Software**: The device is powered by software written in C++ for the Arduino platform, providing flexibility and customization options.
- **3D Models**: 3D models for the device components are designed in Fusion 360.
